Steps:
Import Libraries
Prepare the Data
Create and Train the Model
Make Predictions
Evaluate the Model
Explanation:
Import Libraries: We import the necessary libraries including pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and sklearn for machine learning tools.
Prepare the Data: We create a sample dataset and convert it into a pandas DataFrame. We then separate the predictors (X) from the target variable (Y).
Split the Data: We split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Create and Train the Model: We create a LinearRegression model and train it using the training data.
Make Predictions: We use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.
Evaluate the Model: We evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics.
Display the Coefficients: We display the coefficients and intercept of the trained model.
