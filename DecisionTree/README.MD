#DECISION TREE
A Decision Tree is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It creates a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the features of the data. Decision trees are easy to understand and interpret, and they mimic the human decision-making process by splitting the dataset based on feature values.

Key Concepts:
Nodes:

Root Node: The topmost node that represents the entire dataset and gets split into two or more homogenous sets.
Internal Nodes: Nodes that represent a feature or attribute upon which the dataset is split.
Leaf Nodes: Terminal nodes that represent the outcome or class label for classification or predicted value for regression.
Splitting: The process of dividing the dataset into smaller subsets based on feature values. Different splitting criteria are used depending on the problem (e.g., Gini Index, Entropy for classification).

Pruning: The technique of reducing the size of the tree by removing sections that have little importance. This prevents overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.
Types of Decision Trees:
Classification Trees: Used when the target variable is categorical (e.g., predicting if an email is spam or not).
Regression Trees: Used when the target variable is continuous (e.g., predicting house prices).
